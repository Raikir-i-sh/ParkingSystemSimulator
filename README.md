# ParkingSystemSimulator
This project is focused on building a parking area that takes real-life input about in/out-going cars to manage the parking slots efficiently.
It takes inputs from sensors put on the in-going and out-going gates of parking area in real world & simulates it in virtually. Once a car enters, it's details such as car's registration number, entered time, Car Type, etc are saved. And , the number of cars present inside parking area is decreased by 1. Once the same car exists, it's exit time is saved and number of free slot in parking area is restored by 1. This data is emitted back to Arduino that can be displayed in real world screen that users can see in order to know how many slots are empty inside a parking area.  
*For further details, a documentation .docx file has also been uploaded.*
